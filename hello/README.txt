This is a sample program for showing you how to use a makefile.

Make sure you have gcc installed and type 'make hello'

If you do not have gcc installed, but you have another c compiler
installed on your machine, simply edit the makefile and change the
compiler command line (line 2, to CC=yourcompiler) in order for it
to work.
